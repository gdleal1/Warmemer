# üìñ About 

This project consists of developing a 3D game in C++ using the [OpenGL API](https://www.opengl.org/), inspired by the *Warhammer* universe and incorporating elements of first-person shooter (FPS) games with turn-based dynamics. During development, various functionalities were implemented that meet the fundamental requirements for modern graphics systems, such as:

1. **Advanced 3D modeling with complex polygonal meshes**, allowing detailed representation of characters and scenarios.
2. **Application of interactive geometric transformations**, controlled at runtime by the user, such as translations and rotations.
3. **Free and look-at camera systems**, enabling different viewing perspectives in the 3D environment.
4. **Use of object instances** to optimize memory usage and facilitate the replication of graphic elements with different transformations.
5. **Implementation of three types of intersection tests**, essential for detecting collisions and interactions in the environment.
6. **Application of diffuse and Blinn-Phong lighting models**, simulating the realistic behavior of light on the surfaces of objects.
7. **Use of Phong and Gouraud interpolation techniques**, allowing for visual variations in the shading applied to the models.
8. **Texture mapping on all objects**, enriching the visual appearance with realistic details.
9. **Position variations and vectors based on cubic B√©zier curves**, enabling smooth trajectories.
10. **Animations controlled by time variation**, ensuring fluidity and synchronization in movements.

This project demonstrates mastery of modeling, animation and graphics rendering techniques, as well as consolidating knowledge of interactive graphics programming, and is a complete example of the application of computer graphics fundamentals in a gaming environment.
