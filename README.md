# 📖 About 

This project was developed as the final work for the discipline of *Fundamentos de Computação Gráfica (INF01047)* - UFRGS. It consists of developing a 3D game in C++ using the [OpenGL API](https://www.opengl.org/), inspired by the *Warhammer* universe and incorporating elements of first-person shooter (FPS) games with turn-based dynamics. During development, various functionalities were implemented that meet the fundamental requirements for modern graphics systems, such as:

1. **Advanced 3D modeling with complex polygonal meshes**
2. **Application of interactive geometric transformations**
3. **Free and look-at camera systems**
4. **Use of object instances**
5. **Implementation of three types of intersection tests**
6. **Application of diffuse and Blinn-Phong lighting models**
7. **Use of Phong and Gouraud interpolation techniques**
8. **Texture mapping on all objects**
9. **Position variations and vectors based on cubic Bézier curves**
10. **Animations controlled by time variation**

This project demonstrates mastery of modeling, animation and graphics rendering techniques, as well as consolidating knowledge of interactive graphics programming, and is a complete example of the application of computer graphics fundamentals in a gaming environment.
